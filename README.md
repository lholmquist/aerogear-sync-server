## AeroGear Data Synchronization Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-sync-server.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-sync-server)
This project aims to prototype a data synchronization protocol that can be used by AeroGear's client libraries.

AeroGear Sync consists of the following modules:


## AeroGear Server Differential Synchronization Project
This implementation is based on Google's [Differential Synchonrization](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35605.html) by Neil Fraser.

### Resources
* [Differential Synchronization presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hp_1jqpY8)
* [Differential Synchronization paper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub35605.html)
* [Differential Synchronization step by step keynote presentation](https://www.icloud.com/iw/#keynote/BAKHgqmqd5ETPe9ebKyBhSINoBo1QHaNPYeF/diffsync)

### Modules

* [api](./api)  
Contains the interfaces for the server and client, plus definitions of common types.

* [core](./core)  
Contains a base implementation of the common types from the [api](./api) module. These are used by both the
[client-core](./client-core) and the [server-core](./server-core) modules.

* [synchronizers](./synchronizers)  
Contains a implementations that perform the synchronization operations in the Differential Synchronization algorithm.

* [server](./server)  
Contains a concrete implementations of the server side core API. These implementation is inteded to be "embedded" in a server
component, like a Servlet, a Netty server, etc.

* [client](./client)  
Contains a concrete implementation of the client side core API. This implementation is inteded to be "embedded" in a client
component, like a Netty client, an Android device, etc.

* [itests](./itests)  
Contains tests that use both the [server-core](./server-core) and [client-core](./client-core) in cooperation.

### Usage

#### Starting the server
    cd server/server-netty
    mvn exec:exec


#### Building/Testing
To build this project simply use the following maven command:

    mvn install

To run the the unit tests:

    mvn test
    
### Creating a distribution
A distribution (a "fat" jar) can be produces by running the following maven command from the [distribution](./distribution)
directory:

    mvn package

This willl produce a ```target/aerogear-sync-server-VERSION.jar``` file.
